# Exploratory‑Analysis‑EDA‑

**Step‑by‑step Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
A beginner‑friendly project that explores the *Students Performance* dataset with visual and statistical insights.



##  Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to understand the dataset’s structure, distributions, relationships, and patterns **before any predictive modeling**. EDA helps uncover:

- Data trends and distributions  
- Relationships between features  
- Outliers and data quality issues  
- Insights for further analysis or modeling 🚀  
(E.g., identifying patterns in math scores, reading scores, and writing scores, correlations, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}




##  Tools & Technologies

This project uses:

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Statistical summaries** and **correlation analysis**

These are common EDA tools used across data science projects to clean, visualize, and summarize datasets before modeling. 



##  What You Will Learn

By working through this EDA, you will learn how to:

✔ Load and inspect a real dataset  
✔ Identify variable distributions  
✔ Find relationships between multiple variables  
✔ Visualize data with histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots  
✔ Interpret trends and observations  

This process is essential in data science to **understand data deeply before building models**.
